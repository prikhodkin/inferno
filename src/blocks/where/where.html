              <p>Seen from any point in the city, including the famous Kapellbrücke bridge, hotel Сhâteau Gütsch has long been Lucerne’s signature point.</p>
              <p>It’s rightfully considered one of the most interesting historic hotels in Switzerland—the famous guests it houses being one of the reasons. Queen Victoria spent time here, as did Thomas Mann, who lived in Lucerne for quite some time. Béatrice Ephrussi de Rothschild was a frequent guest in her time, not to say for the many celebrities of the 20th century: Tom Johns, Henry More, Madeleine Albright, and many others.</p>
              <p>The history of Château Gütsch hotel is rather unique. In 1590 the guard tower Unoth was built, which finalized the construction of the citadel walls. In 1879, entrepreneur Ignac Basinger bought the building and received the approval to turn the landmark into a hotel, a part of which burned down in 1888. The building received its current look with the towers and bay windows during the post-fire reconstruction.</p>

              <p>The backdrop of the exhibition can surely be called the best view in the city. How else would you describe Luzerner See and topped with Mount Pilatus and the range that surrounds it? From the vista point here you can see all of Lucerne in all its magnificence: the oldest wooden bridge in Europe Kapellbrücke, the grand citadelle walls, and the old city with its typically Swiss houses and the medieval Town Hall.</p>
